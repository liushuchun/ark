MXNet is a deep learning framework designed for both *efficiency* and *flexibility*.
It allows you to mix the [flavours](http://mxnet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/program_model.html) of
deep learning programs together to maximize the efficiency and your productivity.

Features
--------
* To Mix and Maximize
  - Mix all flavours of programming models to maximize flexibility and efficiency.
* Lightweight, scalable and memory efficient.
  - Minimum build dependency, scales to multi-GPUs with very low memory usage.
* Auto parallelization
  - Write numpy-style ndarray GPU programs, which will be automatically parallelized.
* Language agnostic
  - With support for python, c++, R, more to come.
* Cloud friendly
  - Directly load/save from S3, HDFS, AZure
* Easy extensibility
  - Extending no requirement on GPU programming.

History
-------
MXNet is initiated and designed in collaboration by authors from [cxxnet](https://github.com/dmlc/cxxnet), [minerva](https://github.com/dmlc/minerva) and [purine2](https://github.com/purine/purine2). The project reflects what we have learnt from the past projects. It combines important flavour of the existing projects, being efficient, flexible and memory efficient.
