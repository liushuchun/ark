MXNet Documentation
===================
[MXNet](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) is a deep learning framework designed for both *efficiency* and *flexibility*.
It allows you to mix the flavours of deep learning programs together to maximize the efficiency and your productivity.

Open Source Design Notes
------------------------
This section contains the design document and notes we made for mxnet system design and deep learning
libraries in general. We believe that open sourcing the system design note, its motivations and choices
can benefit general audience, for those who uses deep learning and who builds deep learning systems.

This section will be updated with self-contained design notes on various aspect of deep learning systems,
in terms of abstraction, optimization and trade-offs.
