Symbolic Configuration and Execution in Pictures
================================================
This is a self-contained tutorial that explains the Symbolic construction and execution in pictures.
You are recommend to read this together with [Symbolic API](symbol.md).

Compose Symbols
---------------
The symbols are description of computation we want to do. The symbolic construction API generates the computation
graph that describes the need of computation. The following picture is how we compose symbols to describe basic computations.

- The ```mxnet.symbol.Variable``` function creates argument nodes that represents inputs to the computation.
- The Symbol is overloaded with basic element-wise arithmetic operations. 

Configure Neural Nets
---------------------
Besides fine-grained operations, mxnet also provide a way to perform big operations that is analogy to layers in neural nets.
We can use these operators to describe a neural net configuration.

Example of Multi-Input Net
--------------------------
The following is an example of configuring multiple input neural nets.

Bind and Execute Symbol 
-----------------------
When we need to execute a symbol graph. We call bind function to bind ```NDArrays``` to the argument nodes
to get a ```Executor```.

You can call ```Executor.Forward``` to get the output results, given the binded NDArrays as input.

Bind Multiple Outputs
---------------------
You can use ```mx.symbol.Group``` to group symbols together then bind them to 
get outputs of both.

But always remember, only bind what you need, so system can do more optimizations for you.


Calculate Gradient
------------------
You can specify gradient holder NDArrays in bind, then call ```Executor.backward``` after ```Executor.forward```
will give you the corresponding gradients.

Simple Bind Interface for Neural Nets
-------------------------------------
Sometimes it is tedious to pass the argument NDArrays to the bind function. Especially when you are binding a big
graph like neural nets. ```Symbol.simple_bind``` provides a way to simplify
the procedure. You only need to specify input data shapes, and the function will allocate the arguments, and bind
the Executor for you.

Auxiliary States
----------------
Auxiliary states are just like arguments, except that you cannot take gradient of them. These are states that may 
not be part of computation, but can be helpful to track. You can pass the auxiliary state in the same way as arguments.
